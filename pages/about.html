            <p hidden id="intro-paragraph"> &emsp; Hello! <br>
                &emsp; To give a little background, I am from a small town in Texas have always tinkered with computers. Out of highschool I joined the United States Coast Guard. First tour was as a non-rated Fireman at USCG smallboat station Fort Pierce. There I preformed routine maintenance on our sea craft,
                conducted law enforcement missions, and search and rescue operations. Later my training led me to become a 3rd class Avionics Electrical Technician where my job was to troubleshoot, coordinate, and conduct maintenace on USCG aircraft.
                I also operated the in flight radar for law enforcement and search and rescue operations.<br>
                &emsp;While in service I attended a local community college where I took Computer Science courses. After Seperating I decided to pursue my higher education further at Rutgers University-New Brunswick where I am today. In my free time you can catch me 
                working on personal projects. I like to make small games or low level graphics tech. My interest in the field stems from my fascination in the process of bringing virtual worlds to life.<br>
                Outside of school and graphics I like to play guitar, video games, and read. I try to go outside sometimes too.
