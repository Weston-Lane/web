            <p hidden id="intro-paragraph"> &emsp; Hi, If you're seeing this site it means that you are probably a recruiter or someone who has gone extermely deep in the google search results.
                 Either way thanks for checking this website out.<br>
                &emsp; To give a little background, I am a small town Texas boy who has always tinkered with computers. Out of highschool I joined the United States Coast Guard. First tour was as a non-rated Fireman at USCG smallboat station Fort Pierce. There I preformed routine maintenance on our sea craft,
                conducted law enforcement missions, and search and rescue operations. Later my training led me to become a 3rd class Avionics Electrical Technician where my job was to troubleshoot, coordinate, and conduct maintenace on USCG aircraft.
                I also operated the in flight radar for law enforcement and search and rescue operations.<br>
                &emsp;While in service I attended a local community college where I took Computer Science courses. After Seperating I decided to pursue my higher education further at Rutgers University-New Brunswick where I am today. In my free time you can catch me 
                working on projects. I like to make small games or low level graphics tech since I'm a dweeb. --This time I have spent used to be a function to skill up, but now, I'm just building for fun and hope employers can see the value in that--.
