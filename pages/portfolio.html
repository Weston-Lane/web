                    RayCasting Engine: This is a raycaster for a classic style fps game. It is going to be my final project for my computer graphics course this semster. I would like to
                    continue development on it afterwards to see where it goes.

                    I wanted to embark on this project to see how classical rendering was done on these games and to give me a foundation
                    in using modern OpenGL.
                    <p class="item-desc inner">I am using OpenGL with my own abstraction layer for the VBOs, EBOs, VAOs, and Shaders. This project has been an exercise in
                        understanding OpenGL more than anything but I have also learned much more, such as map projection, ray casting, batch rendering, and ray intersection techniques.
                        Soon I will add textures, enemies, and weapons. I also want to port this to WebGL and get it working on this website.

                    I could have just used Microsoft Excel but why not just make it myself. Continued work will be on including serialization for saving and loading files.

                    data buffers for redering techniques. Ray-sphere intersection techniques, the Phong reflection model to create realistic speculate and diffuse reflections, and setting
                    up coordinate spaces for cameras and objects. I still have a lot to learn, However!.

                    Snaek(that's the title, not a typo): This is snake. You know it, but I added some basic AI you have to dodge while collecting the food. This was made with C++ and the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.raylib.com/">Raylib</a> framework
                    (an OpenGL wrapper library tailored for making games).<a class="proj-links" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/Weston-Lane/snake-but-bad"><img class="right-float proj-gif" src="../images/snake.gif"></a>
                    This project consisted of creating a redering API and simple game logic. I wanted to apply some of knowledge I have learned in school in a
                    fun and interactive way. This was one of the first projects I made and it shows. However, I am still proud of the work I put into it.
                    <p class="item-desc">Though I consider this project to be complete, I think there is real potential for a game like snake to be combined with bullet hell

                    exports all level data into a JSON format, the API I made parses the positional data of the tiles and any other attributes (such as collision), then renders them onto screen.
                    <p class="item-desc"> I wanted to make this tool to help my workflow in loading in my own maps for some lower level game projects I wanted to try. I try to make my own tools
